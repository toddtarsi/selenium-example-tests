# Selenium Suite:

The purpose of this repo is two(three)fold.

1. Help other Selenium developers, by making test maintenance a bit easier.
2. Showcase the immense amount of technology inside of Selenium builder / IDE, as this is largely extending or gutted from SE.

## How to use this repo:

This is a convenience repo, to gather all of my utilities in one place.
Feel free to check the individual repos to find out more.

## Special thanks to:

The SE builder team and anyone using Selenium
